We cannot open source our fine-tune region-cls model because it is an OpenAI GPT-4o fine-tune model. We offer the script to convert region_cls_ft_train.csv to OpenAI Playground Fine-Tune API friendly format. User can use [OpenAI Fine-Tune API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization) to finish fine-tune task.
